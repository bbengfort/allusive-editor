Helpful tutorial on building text editors with Tkinter: [Vroom! A Simple DarkRoom Remake in Tkinter](http://effbot.org/zone/vroom.htm). Documentation on event bindings can be found at [Tkinter Events and Bindings](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-events-and-bindings.htm). We're currently having trouble with py2app, and are following [this thread](http://marc.info/?l=pythonmac-sig&m=120024539627774) to see if we can upgrade setuptools and modulegraph to get it to build.
